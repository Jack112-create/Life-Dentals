## UX

### User Stories

* As a user, I want to a clear form of navigation so that I can navigate through the site more easily.

* As a user, I want to be able to book an appointment so that I can have the required treatment.

* As a user, I want to update or cancel my bookings so that I can reschedule for a later date.

* As a user, I want to be able to register and log in so that I can view my bookings.

* As a user, I want to view all available treatments so that I can choose the appropriate booking.

* As a user, I want to read any testimonials so that I can read people's opinions and experiences of the provided service.

* As a user, I want to have access to contact information, so that I can get in touch with the clinic.

* As an admin user, I want access to all patient bookings so that I can delete or update any bookings (incomplete).

### Site Goals

* As a site owner, I want to provide a service to people looking to receive oral care so that they can improve their oral health.

* As a site owner, I want to provide users with a visually appealing website so that they have a positive user experience when browsing the site.

### Strategy

* Life Dentals is a dental service web application that provides both regular users, and users that have created an account, with information about the services that are available at Life Dentals. Users that have created an account gain access to the booking feature, allowing them to book in with Life Dentals for anytime, for any treatment, for any date.

* The overall design is quite simple, reducing the barrier that users sometime face when visiting their favourite sites.

### Scope

Features to be included:

* Responsive Design - The site should function correctly on all screen sizes. The design should allow users to have a good experience when visitng the site no matter what device they use when visiting.

* Navigation -  Navigation elements should be clear to the user. The main site navigation should be clear to the user that the links will bring them to other pages on the site.

* Users should be able to create, update and delete a booking if they have created an account. This feature should not be available to users who do not have an account.
